# Image-to-Text-to-Speech

Background: In continuation of what I have learned in the mobile application, 
I decided to develop another app that would be beneficial to my visually impaired sister. 
My sister and her husband who happened to be visually impaired too are living in a separate house. 
They worked also as massage therapists; This requires them to travel every day. 
They pay their bills and do a grocery too.

Statement of the problem: Most of the time, they required assistance from another person to read their bills, 
grocery receipts, and ID. In times that they cannot call someone to help them, 
it would be hard for them to read those documents. 
So, I decided to create an app that can take a picture of the document and convert the image to text. 
There is a speaker icon where the text will be converted to voice.
